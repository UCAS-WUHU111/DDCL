name: Deep Learning of Causal Structures in High Dimensions under Data Limitations
description: This capsule contains the official PyTorch implementation of the paper
  "Deep Learning of Causal Structures in High Dimensions". The proposed method DDCL
  considers a version of the causal structure learning problem in which the desired
  output consists of binary indicators of causal relationships between observed variables.
  This capsule provides the architecture and code to run tests.
